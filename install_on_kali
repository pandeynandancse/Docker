1) Add Docker PGP key:

                curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/debian/gpg | sudo apt-key add -
                
                
                
                
2) Configure Docker APT repository (Kali is based on Debian testing, which will be called buster upon release, and Docker now has support for it):

                echo 'deb [arch=amd64] https://download.docker.com/linux/debian buster stable' | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/docker.list
                
                
                
                
                
3) sudo apt-get update



4) If you had older versions of Docker installed, uninstall them:

                     sudo apt-get remove docker docker-engine docker.io
                     
                     
                     
                     
 5) Install Docker:

                     sudo apt-get install docker-ce
                     
                     
                     
                     
                     
                     
 6) Test:

             sudo docker run hello-world           
             
             
             
             
             
             
 7) After installation, Docker service will be started, but not enabled (i.e. it will not be started automatically after reboot). To start it:

             sudo systemctl start docker            
                     
                     
                     
                     
                     
                     
  8) To allow your non-root user to use Docker, add the user to docker group:

              sudo usermod -aG docker $USER
